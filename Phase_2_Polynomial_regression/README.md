# ğŸ“ˆ Phase 2: Polynomial Regression (From Scratch)

## What I Did
- Extended linear regression to fit nonlinear data using polynomial features (xÂ², xÂ³, etc.).
- Understood overfitting and degree selection.

## File Included
- `polynomial Regression curve.py`
- `Polynomial regression.py`
- `model_params.npz`

## Key Concepts
- Feature transformation: [x, xÂ², xÂ³]
- Cost calculation with polynomial terms
- Visualizing model fit vs data

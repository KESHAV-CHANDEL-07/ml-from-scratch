# 📊 Phase 1: Simple Linear Regression (From Scratch)

## What I Did
- Implemented simple linear regression from scratch using only Python and NumPy.
- Learned how to calculate predictions, cost (MSE), and update parameters using gradient descent.

## File Included
- `simple_linear_regression.py`

## Key Concepts
- Hypothesis: y = θ₀ + θ₁x
- Cost function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Manual gradient descent updates

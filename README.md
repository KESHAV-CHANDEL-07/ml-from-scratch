# 🤖 Machine Learning From Scratch — by Keshav Chandel

Welcome to my personal ML journey where I build everything from **scratch using only Python and NumPy**, focusing on **deep mathematical understanding**, **matrix operations**, and **step-by-step logic** — not just using prebuilt libraries.

## 📚 What I've Covered So Far

### ✅ Phase 1: Simple Linear Regression

* Implemented 1D linear regression from scratch.
* Learned cost function (MSE), gradient descent, and matrix dot products.
* Manually predicted new values and visualized loss reduction.

📁 Folder: `Phase_1_Simple_Regression/`

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Polynomial Regression

* Extended linear regression to fit **nonlinear data** using polynomial terms (x², x³, ...).
* Observed overfitting vs underfitting.
* Trained and predicted on curved data manually.

📁 Folder: `Phase_2_Polynomial_Regression/`

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Multiple Linear Regression

* Added support for multiple input features (2-feature and 4-feature models).
* Calculated cost, gradients, and updates using **matrix math**.
* Used real-world-like data (e.g., house prices) to predict with multiple variables.

### ✅ Phase 4: Logistic Regression

* Implemented binary classification using logistic regression from scratch.
* Applied sigmoid activation, binary cross-entropy loss, and matrix-based gradients.
* Built a diabetes prediction model with user input.
* Evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix.
* Added input validation to prevent wrong medical predictions.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

I want to:

* Master the **core math and matrix logic** behind ML
* Build a **strong foundation for future advanced models**
* Apply this in **real-world hardware-based ML projects**
* Become internship/job-ready with a **hands-on + deep understanding** profile

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (only for optional plots)
* 💡 No scikit-learn or ML libraries — everything is done manually!

---

## 🚀 What's Next

* Phase 5: Regularization (Ridge, Lasso)
* Phase 6: Logistic Regression with multiclass (softmax)
* Phase 7: Apply scikit-learn and compare results
